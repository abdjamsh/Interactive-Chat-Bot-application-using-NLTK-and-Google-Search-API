Description 
This project is aimed to implement a web-based chat bot to assist students to learn the computer science related subjects using tools that expose artificial intelligence methods such as natural language understanding. Allowing users to interact with the chat bot using natural language input and to train the chat bot using appropriate methods so it will be able to generate a response. The prototype was mainly implemented using NLTK library.


Output:
         Description of output:
User will start with a greeting and proceed with their query regarding computer science related domain. Bot will take this query and search in the dataset and corresponding output is displayed. If the query doesnâ€™t match in the data set it will give appropriate message to handle the query.
